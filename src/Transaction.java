/*Each transaction will carry a certain amount of data:
- The public key(address) of the sender of funds.
- The public key(address) of the receiver of funds.
- The value/amount of funds to be transferred.
- Inputs, which are references to previous transactions that prove the sender has funds to send.
- Outputs, which shows the amount relevant addresses received in the transaction. ( These outputs are referenced as inputs in new transactions )
- A cryptographic signature, that proves the owner of the address is the one sending this transaction and that the data hasnâ€™t been changed
